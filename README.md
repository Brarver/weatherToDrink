* This application helps the user plan for parties or special events by suggesting an alcoholic drink based on the weather where the user is currently located. The app allows the user to save drinks to a 'favorites' section to help them in their selection process. The users' favorite drinks will remain visible until the user closes their browser.

* The application uses AJAX calls to 'openweathermap.org' and 'thecocktaildb.com' to provide weather and cocktail information respectively.

* To get started simply click the link above and browse through the recommended drink options. When you see a drink that may meet your criteria click the heart icon to save the drink to your 'favorites' section.

* To change the search location enter in the city name or zip code of the location at the top of the page and click 'submit'
